# Homework Solutions 

## [Homework 1 - Introduction to Computer Architecture](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS260-IntroductionToComputerArchitecture/blob/Homeworks/Sol1_CptS260_Spring22.pdf)
### Assignmnet Description:
#### Topics Covered:
- **Performance Evaluation**: This homework introduces concepts related to evaluating the performance of different processors based on clock rate and cycles per instruction (CPI). Students learn to calculate performance metrics such as instructions per second and to compare different processors based on these metrics.
  - Example: The homework compares three processors (P1, P2, P3) with different clock rates and CPI, calculating their performance and discussing the implications of these differences.
    
- **Clock Cycles and Instructions**: Students are required to calculate the total number of cycles and instructions for different processors, enhancing their understanding of how processor speed and efficiency are affected by clock rates and CPI.
  
- **Number Representations**: The homework covers number systems used in digital computers, specifically focusing on signed and unsigned binary numbers. Students convert binary numbers to decimal and vice versa, exploring the range of values that can be represented.
  - Example: Conversion exercises involve translating between binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal systems, as well as extending signed numbers to fit specific bit-width requirements.
    
- **Impact of CPI Changes**: It explores the effects of changes in CPI on processor performance, requiring students to recalculate performance metrics after adjusting CPI values.
